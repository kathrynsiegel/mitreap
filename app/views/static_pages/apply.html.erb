				<h4 class="apply-timeline-header">REAP Champion profile:</h4>
				<p>
					The REAP Champion is the leader of his or her team and is deeply connected to the mission of inspiring innovation-based entrepreneurial ecosystems. This individual works in this capacity on a daily basis, and will understand the local landscape and which key players to engage to create the greatest impact.  This individual will be critical in helping to build regional support for the program, assemble key players to serve on the regional REAP team of 5-7, secure funding for participation, and work closely with the MIT REAP staff team.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Though champions may come from many places and should be determined based on the regional context, our experience shows that successful champions often have the following profile: energetic, once-practicing Entrepreneurs now seated in a business-facing public policy, government, or economic development role, with strong ties to regional and national government and deep connections across stakeholders.  This person should have a current organizational mission aligned with that of MIT REAP and a job role related to accountability for creating or implementing a regional strategy to accelerate regional prosperity and economic growth and development through innovation-driven entrepreneurship.

					Team Assembly information
				</h4>
				<p>
					Each REAP team consists of 5-7 team members. The acceptance of regions into the MIT REAP Program is evaluated based on the strength and commitment of the champion and ability to engage core team members across the stakeholder groups.
				</p>
				<p>
					These stakeholders should be decision-makers of executive level, and have the ability to influence the creation of policy and programs in their own sector, and they should bring an intimate understanding of the current ecosystem and its challenges from their perspectives.  With participation comes responsibility.  Each team member will take on the responsibility of being a Sector Chief, responsible for representing the interests of their sector, identifying opportunities, and working to build support in their sector to execute on various elements of their regional REAP strategy.
